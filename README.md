# BuildingInPublic
I want to see how strong community work can be by attempting to launch an app that is build by everyone that wants to contribute. 
The working title will be "VisionVox"

Context: I'm working for WeAreDevelopers (no tech background) and everyone that knows our WeAreDevelopers World Congress knows our main stage and the other stages with lots of high quality speakers and content.
Someone of the community sparked an idea in me. Why not having an AI tool that supports speakers on stage, on the fly, without having a hand-held tool like a clicker or just using rudimental 
commands like "switch" or "next slide"?

I want to create a tool - kind of a "Jarvis" from Iron Man - that listens to your speech in real-time and knows exactly when to switch slides, when to get back to a specific slide or topic,
what to create on the fly to support the speaker's vision and content, by, for example, generating a chart, an image, a mind-map, whatever comes to the speaker's mind, in order not to disrupt the flow of speech.

Especially in Q&A-Sessions where there's a lot of Back and Forth, discussions etc. where you could let the AI tool summarize some points from the speaker as well as from the audience. 

There is so much more to this idea, I'd like to realize based on this tool in the future, 
but for now, I'd like to focus on "real-time slide switching based on the context" / "on the words that are thought out loud"

Let's make this happening community! I'm counting on you! Feel free to join me on this ride!
